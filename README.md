AI4ALL Robotic Semantic Navigation and Heart Disease Prediction Code 

AI4ALL is a three week summer residential program at University of Maryland: College Park for rising high school juniors and seniors.
This is my github repository for the heart disease prediction and Robotic Semantic Navigation (RSN) work I completed during my time at AI4ALL.
