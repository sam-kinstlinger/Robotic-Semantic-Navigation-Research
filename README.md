AI4ALL Robotic Semantic Navigation and Heart Disease Prediction Code 

AI4ALL is a three week summer residential program at University of Maryland: College Park for rising high school juniors and seniors.
This is my github repository for the heart disease prediction and Robotic Semantic Navigation (RSN) work I completed during my time at AI4ALL. 

This is the link to a google slides my team made at AI4ALL to aid in presenting our RSN work to UMD faculty and guests:

Slides 9 & 10 each consist of a video showcasing some of our work.
