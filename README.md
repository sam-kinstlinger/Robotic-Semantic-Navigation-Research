## Overview
This repository contains the resources and scripts developed for the Robotic Semantic Navigation (RSN) project. The project involves downloading, processing, and analyzing visual data using YOLOv5 for object detection. It also includes supplementary materials showcasing the project's outcomes.

### Files and Scripts
#### RSN_Colab.ipynb
- A Colab notebook for:
- Downloading images from GitLab.
- Loading YOLOv5 for object detection.
- Performing object detection on a batch of images for evaluation.
#### save_image.py
- A Python script that:
- Uses ROS2 and OpenCV to subscribe to a camera feed.
- Converts images for storage.
- Saves images for subsequent analysis.
